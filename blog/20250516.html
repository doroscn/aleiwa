                                  <h2>Overview</h2>
                                  <p>The use of public LDNS IPs (such as <code>8.8.8.8</code>, <code>1.1.1.1</code>, and <code>9.9.9.9</code>) has been restricted in Iraq, making these IPs inaccessible within the country. This restriction directly affects DNS resolution for services such as IDC (Internet Data Centers) and CDN (Content Delivery Networks). Each server node is now required to use LDNS IPs provided by the local ISP. Additionally, some LDNS IPs are subject to whitelist policies and cannot be accessed across different ISPs. The Aleiwa tool has already collected all LDNS IPs used by major ISPs in Iraq.</p>
                                </section>
                              
                                <section>
                                  <h2>Why Are Public LDNS IPs Restricted?</h2>
                                  <p>Iraq’s network regulatory authorities have imposed these restrictions for security and administrative reasons. Public LDNS IPs are typically operated by global DNS providers like Google, Cloudflare, and Quad9. However, due to their global nature, they may be used to bypass local internet controls or engage in malicious activities. As a result, the Iraqi government has decided to restrict access to these IPs in order to enhance network traffic control.</p>

                                  <h2>Impact on IDC and CDN Services</h2>
                                  <p>IDCs and CDNs rely heavily on DNS resolution to ensure users can access hosted content efficiently. The restriction of public LDNS IPs has disrupted domain resolution within Iraq, negatively impacting user experience. Since each node must now rely on the LDNS IPs provided by its local ISP, IDC and CDN providers must collaborate closely with local ISPs to ensure continued service accessibility.</p>

                                  <h2>Whitelist Policies and Their Consequences</h2>
                                  <p>Some LDNS IPs are subject to strict whitelist policies, meaning they are only accessible within specific ISP networks and are blocked across others. This further complicates DNS resolution in a multi-ISP environment. Service providers must tailor their DNS strategies to accommodate different ISPs’ restrictions to avoid service disruptions.</p>

                                  <h2>Aleiwa Tool: Globe NetworkTools - Public DNS Servers - Globe DNS List</h2>
                                  <p>The Aleiwa tool has compiled the complete list of LDNS IPs used by Iraq’s major ISPs and offers a platform for querying DNS configurations per ISP. With this tool, service providers can better understand Iraq’s network landscape and fine-tune their DNS strategies to ensure service availability within the country.</p>

                                  <h2>Solutions and Recommendations</h2>
                                  <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Collaborate with local ISPs</strong> to ensure DNS strategies align with the local network environment.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Utilize the Aleiwa tool</strong> to query LDNS IPs used by different ISPs and optimize DNS configurations accordingly.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Deploy local DNS resolvers</strong> within Iraq to reduce dependence on public LDNS IPs.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Continuously monitor DNS resolution performance</strong> to detect and address issues in a timely manner.</li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <p>By implementing these strategies, service providers can ensure their services remain stable and accessible in Iraq, while complying with local network regulations.</p>
